			<p>Ballet is one of the most difficult, disciplined, and beautiful art forms. Ballet is truly the foundation of all dances. Ballet teaches self-discipline, correct body placement, strength, and gracefulness. It uses a lot fundamentals of physics which allows the dancers to produce breathtaking performances.</p>

			<p>The concepts of physics used in ballet are the following:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Center of gravity and balance</li>
				<li>Rotational mechanics and the pirouette</li>
				<li>Conservation of Angular Momentum</li>
				<li>Projectile motion and grande jete</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

			<h2>Center of gravity and balance</h2>
			<p>Dance consists of body movements along with motionless poses. These poses often demonstrate balance on a of the body over a small area of support on the floor. A dancer is in a balance state if he/she remains motionless on an area of support and does not fall which is achieved by if the center of gravity lies on a vertical line passing through an area of support at the floor.</p>

			<p>If the dancer is motionless, the sum of all the forces and torques acting on the body must be equal to zero. The force of gravity vertically downward will be balanced by the upward force from the floor to the foot (normal force), acting on the same line.</p>

			<p>If the center of gravity in line is not in line with these equilibrium state forces, the dancer will be unbalanced and will fall to one side due to the angular acceleration.</p>

			<p>A dancer seldom achieves a true balance condition. The center of gravity is close to that "balance area." The difference from that of a completely balance condition is quite small and the dancer still appears to be balanced.</p>

			<h2>Rotational Mechanics and the Pirouette</h2>

			<img class="article" src="https://ladiesinredparedvini.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/giphy.gif" alt="pirouette">

			<p>A pirouette, one of the most common turns in dance a rotation where the dances supports himself/herself on one leg while the other leg is in retire position. Before a pirouette there must be sime form of preparation position followed bya torque exerted against the floor. This torque of the floor against the dancer causes the angular acceleration that produces the turning motion.</p>

			<p>A torque can be exerted against the floor by two feet with some distance. In ballet, pirouettes are commonly done from fourth or fifth position. A turn from fifth position, which has a smaller distance between the two feet will require more force to produce the same torque than a turn from the fourth position, which has a larger distance. This is because torque(<i>T</i>) is equal to the force (<i>F</i>) multiplied by the distance of the lever arm.</p>

			<p>Another way to describe torque is to take account the dancer's Moment of Inertia. The moment of inertia depends on the body mass and its distribution relative to the axis of rotation. </p>

			<p>Using the equation: <i>T=la</i> where</p>
			<ol>
				<li><i>T</i> is the torque</li>
		    	<li><i>l</i> is the distance of the lever arm</li>
		    	<li><i>a</i> is the angular acceleration</li>
			</ol>
			<p>which is analogous to Newton's second law of motion (<i>F=ma</i>), we can calculate the <i>T</i> used for the turn.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Conservation of Angular Momentum</h2>

			<p>Analogous to linear momentum (<i>p=mv</i>), angular momentum is given by the equation <i>L=lw</i> where</p>
			<ol>
				<li><i>L</i> is the total angular momentum</li>
		    	<li><i>l</i> is the distance of the lever arm</li>
		    	<li><i>w</i> is the angular velocity</li>
			</ol>

			<p>It is a conserved quantity and is a constant with no torques acting on a body. In other words, the total angular momentum L of a body can change if there is and external torque acting on it.</p>

			<img class="article" src="https://data.whicdn.com/images/85510936/original.gif" alt="spotting">

			<p>It is sometimes claimed that "spotting" or the action of a dancer's head while turning wherein he/she will try to hold their head in place and fix their eyes on a picture as their body turns and turning the head round once they can't keep it in the same position, can squeeze an extra turn out of a multiple pirouette. But rotating the head does nit change the total angular momentum of the body and therefore cannot contribute any extra turning motion.</p>

			<h2>Projectile Motion and the Grand Jete</h2>

			<p>All jumps involve vertical acclerations and forces. Because gravity acts vertically downward at all times, we can only remain motionless of there is a vertical force supporting our weight (normal force). In order to jump off the ground we need to exert a force downward against the floor greater that our weight. In order to obtain enough force to jump, a dancer is required to bend his/her knees in a position called plie.</p>

			<img class="article" src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/700a31effc66ce8ddd30562db9d2b413/tumblr_np4dv6jtXS1tyxfrho1_500.gif" alt="grand_jete">

			<p>Jumps that involve horizontal motions such as the grand jete have projectile motion. Once the body loses contact with the floor, the center of gravity will follow a parabolic trajectory that is determined by the initial conditions starting on the ground.</p>

			<p>The trajectory will follow the path of a normal projectile - it will begin with an initial velocity (<i>v<sub>0</sub></i>), which will decrease as the dancer rises into the air until it reaches zero at the maximum height of the leap. Following this maximum is the descent to the floor which is accelerating downward motion until the dancer reaches the ground again.</p>

			<p><br><br><br><br>To conclude, dance is truly dependent on physical concepts such as momentum, Newton's Laws of motion, rotational mechanics, and linear kinematics. Analysis of ballet and correct technique use physics in order to maintain gracefulness, strength, and an overall sense of space required for dancers.</p>
