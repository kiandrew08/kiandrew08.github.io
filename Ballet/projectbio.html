		<p> The concept of biology that is related to ballet is such a huge concept to tackle. Considering that ballet is a form of dancing, it gives limitless opportunity for biology to penetrate the world of ballet. Our organ systems are usually the factors that makes biology and ballet entangled with each other. The list of how biology and ballet is correlated could go on and on but here are a few things that would guide us between the relationship of the two.</p>

	<div id="first"> 
		<p>	When observing the biology behind ballet, one must first determine the main muscles that ballet dancers often use and keep in shape when performing. These muscles help ballet dancers maintain their poise and finesse during the time they perform onstage with people watching them. One of the four main muscles that dancers use is their <strong>Quadriceps</strong> and <strong>Hamstring</strong>. The aesthetic of a straight leg line seems to appeal the ballet dancers so they work hard to consistently achieve long and high leg extensions. With this, ballerinas usually develop strong quadriceps in order to assist with full knee extension and hip flexion and at the same time understand the advantage of deep knee bends. A plié, or the knee bend is a typical fundamental move in ballet wherein the dancer bends her knees causing her hamstrings to contract and thus, forming a powerful and strong hamstring.</p>

		<p>Another muscle that is one of the fundamental muscles is the <strong>Hip</strong> and <strong>Gluteal muscles</strong>. Turnout of the legs situated at the hip socket is a vital element in classical ballet as it helps dancers by using their external hip rotator and gluteal muscles to rotate their legs outward and to sustain rotations during leaps, turns, and some leg extensions. Calves and feet is a fundamental muscle that is used in ballet. Dancers usually strengthen their lower legs and feet in order to achieve a perfect point or rise onto their toes. Barre exercises gives emphasis to the plantar flexion which is a requisite to dancers to engage her calf muscles. Also, when one jumps, a strong push against the floor is required to propel herself upward and then as she lands, she takes care to articulate through her feet to soften her landing and the result of such practices would give you muscle strength in calves and feet.</p>

		<p>Stability is a great demand for ballerinas all across the globe and to achieve it; one must have a strong <strong>abdominal</strong>, <strong>back</strong>, and <strong>pelvic muscle</strong>. Core strengthening helps a dancer maintain correct alignment and balance, ensure that each figure and how she moves is clean and powerful, frees up her extremities, and provide safety from dance-related injuries. Strong core and back could be achieved by training vigorously at the ballet barre. These are the 4 fundamental muscles that ballerinas usually use and enhance in order to achieve greatness.</p>

	<div id="second"> 
		<p>The biology of ballet is not limited to muscles only but it also enters the nervous system. Grace, precision, power, and execution, these are some of the things that a ballet dancer must do in order to achieve a performance that is worth a standing ovation. To do so, one must have a brain that is sharp enough to record and deliver every information and emotion that one must convey for the audience to understand it. A brain that can precisely predict the next move, correctly follow the perfect form, and accurately give the proper emotion is what we need in the world of ballet. With this, ballet dancers are the favorite of scientists when studying about the nervous system and the brain as ballet requires strong physical training as well as sharp neural training.</p>

	<div id="third"> 
			<p>Ballet’s influence to one’s self is not only limited to this as it generally improves the healthcare of a person. There are even other ways and methods that ballet helps us with our day to day activity and enhance us with the skills that we already have. Ballet greatly improves our flexibility. Flexibility is not a prerequisite for ballet; you gain it through practice. Since ballet involves static and dynamic stretching, doing both will contribute to your overall flexibility.</p>


	</div>
	<div id="fourth">
			<p>Ballet delivers a total body workout. Dancing provides a great, overall low-impact aerobic workout. Like other forms of aerobic exercise, dance strengthens the heart, lungs and circulatory system. But the varied movements also improve core strength, coordination, balance, flexibility, muscle tone and spatial awareness. Unlike some other aerobic exercises, like running, most types of dance can be easily modified to meet different physical limitations.</p>
