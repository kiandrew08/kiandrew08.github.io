	 	<h2> <b> Hair Gel </b> </h2>

		<p>Hair gel is a styling product that acts like hair spray, which makes your hair stay in place throughout the day, but instead of being a pure liquid hair gel is a molasses like substance.
		Styling gel is made of mostly styling polymers, which are usually based on vinyl monomers such as PVP  (Polyvinyl Pyrolidone) or VP (Vinyl Pyrolidone).
		</p>

		<br>

		<h2> Are there any chemical reactions involved? </h2>

		<p>In Cosmetic-science and when making hair gel chemical reactions are bad and can be found as a sign of instability in the product. Although that is due to the fact that if the product can’t produce a chemical reaction in the buyers hair because then the gel would not be able to hold the hair still for a long period of time.</p>

		<p>When forming hair gel the styling polymers like (PVP) or Cationic polymers react with the solubilizer or the water to form the gel like substance. Plus when applying the gel the polymers used to make the gel react with the negative amino acids and the keratin on your skin and that allows the gel to harden and keep your hair the way you want it.</p>

		<br>

		<h2> Main Chemicals Components and Compounds found in Hair Gel. </h2>

		<p> The two main chemical components that are found in a hair gel are Aminomethyl Propanol, and PVP K-90 or also known as dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate copolymer</p>

		<h2> <b> Deodorant </b> </h2>

		<p> Deodorants typically include antiseptic ingredients that kill or disable bacteria living in the armpit. That region’s warm and moist environment is an optimal habitat for corynebacteria and other sweat-eating microorganisms. These tiny life-forms feast on perspiration produced by armpit sweat glands, generating stinky waste by-products such as trans-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid. This compound is responsible for the characteristic odor of human sweat, says George Preti, a chemist at Monell Chemical Senses Center who specializes in perspiration research. </p>

		<br>

		<h2> Compounds found in Deodorant </h2>

		<p> <b> Aluminum compounds </b> - are critical to the success of antiperspirant deodorants. The ions of aluminum compounds are drawn into the epidermis. This causes cells to fill with water and swell and blocking the ducts that secrete sweat. Common compounds used as active ingredients in antiperspirant include aluminum chlorohydrate, aluminum zirconium tricholorohydrex glycine, aluminum chlorohydrate, aluminum hydroxybromid. </p>

		<p> <b> Cyclomethicone </b> - When deodorant was first invented, it was not in a convenient plastic stick tube. People had to use cotton swabs to wipe the solution on themselves. However, as the ACS explained, these solutions were largely made of acid or alcohol, which would dry out skin, cause irritation and eliminate odor at the cost of physical discomfort. </p>

		<p> Known as 2,2,4,4,6,6,8,8,10,10-decamethyl-1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,10-pentaoxapentasilecane or C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>30</sub>O<sub>5</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>, cyclomethicone is an odorless, colorless silicone compound that is used in a variety of personal care products. Unlike aluminum compounds, cyclomethicone is too large to pass through the initial layer of skin, so there is no risk of absorption. In Europe, cyclomethicone is regulated for environmental concerns rather than personal health worries.
		</p>

		<p>
		<b> Antibacterial ingredients </b> - Just as aluminum compounds are the antiperspirant active ingredient in deodorants, antibacterials are the active aspect of odor reduction. Antibacterial ingredients work to eliminate the bacteria that cause bad odors from areas where sweat is common. Many types of deodorants use alcohol ingredients that kill bacteria, while others use artificial chemicals such as triclosan.
		</p>
		<p>
		Triclosan is used in a number of personal care products including toothpaste. Many people have been critical of this chemical in over-the-counter products. However, the FDA explained that it is not known to cause harm to humans and has been proven to be beneficial in some circumstances, such as fighting gingivitis.

		<h2> <b> Polyester </b></h2>

		<p> Polyesters are polymers formed from a dicarboxylic acid and a diol.  They have many uses, depending on how they have been produced and the resulting orientation of the polymer chains. </p>
		
		<p> It can be made of various fibres, including silk, nylon, polyester and rayon. Polyester is the most common fibre used for tulle. Rayon tulle is very rare. Tulle is most commonly used for veils, gowns (particularly wedding gowns), and ballet tutus. </p>

		<h2> <b> Pointe Shoes </b></h2>

		<p> Pointe shoes are special box shaped shoes covered in satin. They are usually pink or peach color. Ballet dancers use them because it allows them to stand on their toes and perform dance formations that would otherwise be impossible for the dancer. </p>

		<p> Pointe shoes are made mostly of a fabric called satin. The bottom of the shoe, the sole, has a tough leather strip to provide friction for the dancer. The box of the shoe, the hard part surrounding the top of the feet, under the outside layer of fabric,  is made of glue and satin fabric, similar to paper mache. The vamp is the top part of the front of the outside of the shoe, also made out of satin. </p>

		<br>

		<h2> Materials in Pointe Shoes </h2>

		<p> <b> Glue </b> - The glue, or adhesive, used for point shoes has a very strong compound called Nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose has three possible chemical formulas that form naturally: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>9</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)O<sub>5</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>9</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>9</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. It was first experimented with in the 1830s. Pointe shoe makers use the glue in the making of the shoe to hold it together. It binds the fabric together in the form it needs to be in to allow the dancer to stand on their toes. </p>

		<p> <b> Satin </b>- is a fabric, or more specifically, a weave that usually has a soft surface and dull back. It is used for the outer coat of pointe shoes because it is pleasing to eye as well as surprisingly durable. Satin was made originally from silk in the middle ages. In the mid-1800s pointe shoes started being made with satin. Satin was first made in China. Satin is made with Satin Spar Gypsum with the chemical formula CaSo<sub>4</sub> <sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O. Satin Spar Gypsum is a gray-white mineral with a crystal like structure. </p>

		<p> <b> Leather </b>- The leather on the bottom on the pointe shoes goes through a chemical process called tanning. Tanning involves converting the protein of the raw hide into a material suitable for dancing. The acidity of the hide after pickling, the process of lowering the pH value to an acidic region, has a pH of 2.8-3.2. The hide is immersed into a tanning liquor then it is basificated, a process of very slowly raising the material from the liquor solution. At the end of all this the pH balanced has changed to 3.8-4.2. </p>

		<h2> <b> Dopamine and Serotonin </b></h2>

		<p> <b> Dopamine </b> - is a type of neurotransmitter released by the brain the helps humans and animals with many roles in their lives. It is used a natural medication for the nervous system. It is also needed in some brain cells which helps with parkinson's disease. As Parkinson's disease develops, it can lead to a destruction in the person's divergent thinking process. So they used improvised dance that helped improve their divergent thinking skills. It is produced in the brain, blood vessels, kidneys, digestive system and the nervous system. </p>
		
		<p> <b> Serotonin </b> acts as a chemical that helps to relay signals to one area of the brain to another part.  It  is produced in a unique biochemical conversion process, which begins with tryptophan. Tryptophan hydroxylase combine with tryptophan producing 5-hydroxylase tryptophan, also known as Serotonin. There are biochemical glitches that can happen in the brain where tryptophan is not produced. This causes there to be a shortage of serotonin and it can lead to depression. As well as a major anxiety attack, panic, excessive anger and OCD. </p>
